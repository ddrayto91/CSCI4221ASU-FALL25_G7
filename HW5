1. What is a software service?
A software service is a self-contained function that performs a specific task and can be used by other software through a defined interface.

2. Is a web service a software service?
Yes. A web service is a type of software service that runs over the web using standard protocols.

3. What is a modern web service?
A modern web service uses HTTP, JSON, REST, or similar technologies to allow systems to interact easily across the internet.

4. What are microservices?
Microservices are small, independent services that each handle one specific business function and communicate over lightweight APIs.

5. Example of deriving microservices from a feature
Feature: Online shopping checkout
Microservices you derive:
Payment Service
Cart Service
Inventory Service
Shipping Service
Order Service
Each takes one part of the feature and becomes its own service.

6. Characteristics of microservices
Small and focused
Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business functions
Can use different technologies
Scalable individually

7. How microservices communicate
They communicate through:
REST APIs (HTTP)
Messaging (queues, events)
gRPC
Asynchronous events for decoupling

8. Questions microservice architecture must ask
What should each service do?
How will services communicate?
How will data be split?
How will failures be handled?
How will scaling and security work?

9. What are RESTful services?
RESTful services use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and resources (URLs) to let systems interact simply and consistently.

10. RESTful service principles
Use resources, not actions
Use standard HTTP methods
Stateless communication
Meaningful URLs
Use standard formats like JSON

Support caching
