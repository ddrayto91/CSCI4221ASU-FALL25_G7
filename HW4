1. What are included in the architecture design?
The structure of the system, components, their interactions, technologies used, and design rules.

2. What is the architecture of a software?
It’s the high-level blueprint showing how the system is organized and how parts work together.

3. What is a component of the software architecture?
A major building block of the system, like modules, services, databases, or interfaces.

4. What are the non-functional system quality attributes?
Performance, security, reliability, scalability, usability, and maintainability.

5. What are the architecture design issues?
Choosing the right structure, technology, data flow, communication style, and handling constraints.

6. What architectural design questions should be asked?
How will components connect? What tech will be used? How will data flow? How will we ensure security, performance, and scaling?

7. How are components organized in architecture design?
They are grouped into layers, modules, or services with clear communication paths.

8. Where does the architectural complexity come from?
From many components, integrations, constraints, scaling needs, and different technologies.

9. Name four architecture designs.
Layered, Client-Server, Microservices, Event-Driven.

10. What are the technology choices in architecture design?
Programming languages, frameworks, databases, servers, cloud platforms, and communication protocols.
